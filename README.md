# dot-slash-2

`dot-slash-2` is a library version of
[lein-shorthand](https://github.com/palletops/lein-shorthand), which
is a leiningen plugin.

It lets you create namespaces with proxies to other namespaces. It is
named after the idea of creating a namespace called `.` with dev
utilities, to allow accessing them with the syntax `./foo` from
anywhere without needing to require anything.
